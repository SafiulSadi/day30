<h1 id="osi-and-tcpip-models">OSI and TCP/IP models.</h1>
<p>every protocol has its own header. OSI - open system interconnect
model divide the network into 7 layer. The layers are: application
presentation session transport network data link physical</p>
<h2 id="tcpip-model">TCP/IP model</h2>
<p>it has 4 layers. This is the model that is actually implemented in
the internet.</p>
<h1 id="layers-of-osi-model">Layers of OSI Model.</h1>
<h2 id="physical">physical.</h2>
<p>physical layer is simply the physical media. It might be wireless
media or wired media like fiber optic or copper wire. It uses the 0 and
1 binary digits to send the data.</p>
<h2 id="data-link-layer">data link layer</h2>
<p>data link layer uses physical medium to do the communication. Data
link layer is mainly used for one to one connections. example of office
network.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p><img src="img.png" alt="img.png" /></p>
<p>different devices connected to a switch and then connected to a
router. So, the communication that happens between your local area
network is done by the data link layer. The data link layer is
responsible for communication between your local area network using a
device called switch. Switch only processes the data link layer headers.
switch, lan, wireless wi-fi. shared medium like ethernet. collision
handling.</p>
<h2 id="network-layer">Network layer</h2>
<p>Network layer devices are routers. All the routing happens using
network layer. Network layer is implemented by IP protocol. IP protocol
is part of TCP/IP model, which is a practical model. OSI is more of a
theoretical model. IP protocol in the TCP/IP model is connectionless
protocol. it is not reliable.</p>
<h2 id="transport-layer">Transport layer</h2>
<p>transport layer does end to end deliveries. Many processes are
running at a time in computers. Transport layer provides 5 services.
flow control, error control, connection services, connection release. 0
- 4 where 4 provides all the services. Internet actually implements
TCP/IP model. The internet layer of the transport implements TCP and UDP
2 protocol. TCP has all the functionalities flow control, error control,
and connection oriented etc. UDP provides the minimum form of
implementation of transport layer.</p>
<h2 id="session-layer">Session layer</h2>
<p>Not implemented in the internet. Session layer does session
management and authentication in the OSI model. These things in TCP/IP
are implemented in the application layer. one more thing it does is
combining of multiple streams. i.e. video, and webpage.</p>
<h2 id="presentation-layer">Presentation layer</h2>
<p>Not part of TCP/IP. Data compression on the sender side and data
decompression on the receiver side. It also does encoding and decoding
of the data. Also, it does encryption and decryption.</p>
<h2 id="application-layer">Application layer</h2>
<p>This layer is where your application work. for example your web
browser, email client, skype. in the actual implementation the
presentation and the session layer is not there. So, the application
layer uses the services of the transport layer. Transport layer provides
services like port number and ip address.</p>
<p><img src="img_1.png" alt="img_1.png" /> <img src="img_2.png"
alt="img_2.png" /></p>
<p>If required the application can implement its own presentation and
session parts. Some realworld ex: HTTP, SMTP, DNS, FTP, SSH</p>
<h1 id="tcpip">TCP/IP</h1>
<p><img src="img_3.png" alt="img_3.png" /></p>
<p>4 LAYER TCP/IP model. link layer does both physical layer and data
link layer of the OSI model. It provides all the functionalities of the
physical and the data link layer. Network layer in OSI might be reliable
or unreliable, but in the TCP/IP model this is always unreliable,
connectionless, and the protocol that we use her is IP. The transport
layer provides end to end connection, error control, error handling. UDP
and TCP. UDP is connectionless and TCP provides everything and
congestion handling. examples of tcp are http and ftp. udp examples are
dns and DHCP. Application layer is the same as OSI model. It is
implemented by the web browser or the email client by using the services
of the transport layer.</p>

<p>Data that is coming from the upper layer maybe divided into smaller
units and then the current layer adds its own headers to the smaller
individual units.</p>
<h1 id="data-link-layer-1">Data link layer</h1>
<p>Data link layer is the 4th layer from the top and 2nd layer from the
bottom in the TCP/IP model. The main task of the data link layer is to
take a packet from the network layer and add its own header and trailer
and create a frame. The unit that the data link layer sends to the
receiver is called frame. IP layer sends a packet and data link layer
sends a frame.</p>
<p><img src="img_5.png" alt="img_5.png" /></p>
<p>Then the frame is sent over the physical media (wired/wireless). The
physical layer only understands 1s and 0s. In the receiver side, it
parses the packet and sends it to the network layer. Real world example
is a police man who makes sure person passing from one side to another
does so without any issues.</p>
<p><img src="img_6.png" alt="img_6.png" /></p>
<p>Traffic police person, does not care where they are coming and where
they are going. It only cares about if the data is going through form
one end to another end of the throat without any issues.</p>
<p>It does not care where the data is coming from or where it is going.
It only cares about this communication from one end to another end must
happen conveniently without any errors.</p>
<p>data link layer is implemented in the network interface card, which
has a 48 bit mac address. Mac address is unique. Network layer packets
have an IP address. The frames have headers that has source ethernet
address and destination ethernet address, which are MAC addresses (48
bit unique address).</p>
<pre><code># this is a docstring, which you can write codes in.
</code></pre>
<p>unique worldwide MAC address. your network layer packets have IP
addresses and these frames have source and destination ethernet
addresses.</p>
<p>we can also say that a part of data link layer is implemented in the
operating system. OS provides drivers for the network interface
card.</p>
<p>small office networks. there is a switch that connects multiple
laptops. This switch is connected to the ISP router. And this ISP router
usually has 2 interfaces. one interface is connected to the switch and
another is connected to the internet.</p>
<p><img src="img_7.png" alt="img_7.png" /></p>
<p>A router has 2 or more interfaces and a router creates multiple
subnets. Or in other words it allows multiple networks or subnets to
connect to each other.</p>
<pre><code>A tab insercts a into this box mode</code></pre>
<p>Any direct one-to-one communication between any network happens
through the data link layer. Any road where there is an end-to-end
communication it happens through the data link layer.</p>
<p>Switch is a data link layer device. It has multiple ports which
allows multiple device to connect to it. And one port is connected to
the router which connects you to the internet. This switch allow these
devices to directly connect to each other using data link layer. These
devices communicate with each other using MAC addresses. This
communication can happen directly through switch.</p>
<p>You can have this communication without switches by using BUS where
multiple devices were connected to them. There used to be collisions.
The collisions were handled using CS-MA/CD and ALOHA protocol.</p>
<p>With switch there’s no collision. It has collision domain. Switch has
internal connections, which directly connects devices. It avoids
collisions.</p>
<p>The home wi-fi still has collision chances as they use the same
medium unlike switches. CS-MA/CA protocol is used to handle collisions.
CA means collision avoidance.</p>
<p><img src="img_8.png" alt="img_8.png" /></p>
<h3 id="functionalities-of-data-link-layer">Functionalities of Data Link
Layer</h3>
<p>Framing - we receive an IP packet, which is to be transferred through
the physical media. We have to make sure the receiving end’s data link
layer receives this packet correctly without any issues. The physical
layer may cause some issues when transferring this packet because of
signal issues as it uses twisted pair, fiber optic, wi-fi, or some other
media. There are possibility of errors in the physical layer.</p>
<p>Framing means it takes the network layer packet it adds the
destination MAC address. It has to figure out the destination MAC
address by using ARP protocol. It puts the destination MAC address in
the header.</p>
<p><img src="img_9.png" alt="img_9.png" /></p>
<p>It takes this packet and uses it as payload and makes a frame. In the
frame it adds a header and the header has many things like source MAC
address, destination MAC address. This also adds a trailer, which
includes a checksum to handle and figure out the errors. The trailer is
used to check if there was any error while the frame was going through
the physical medium.</p>
<p>The physical layer only understand binary. There might be multiple
frames that has be sent across the physical media. How does receiving
end figure out when has a frame ended or a new frame began.</p>
<p>Two ways to know if a new frame has begun are bit stuffing and byte
stuffing.</p>
<p><img src="img_10.png" alt="img_10.png" /></p>
<p>Byte stuffing - in byte stuffing we add a special flag to the
beginning of the frame. When the receiver sees this flag it knows that a
new frame has begun. This flag might be present in the packet. So we use
an escape character to handle that.</p>
<p><img src="img_11.png" alt="img_11.png" /></p>
<p>Bit stuffing - 11110 may be added in the beginning of the frame. If
111110 is present in the payload it adds 111110 again. if the receiver
sees it twice it removes one copy of it and does not consider it as a
beginning of a new frame.</p>
<p>Bit stuffing is difficult to implement in reality so the byte
stuffing method is used.</p>
<h3 id="error-detection">Error detection</h3>
<p>If there was an error in the physical layer it ignores such frames
that has errors. Detecting the error there are multiple methods one is
called parity where we add a parity bit and another is checksum, and
another one is CRC. CRC most common method for error detection.</p>
<h3 id="error-and-flow-control">error and flow control</h3>
<p>once we have detected the error we must be able to handle it. And the
most common way is retransmission. Receiver simply ignores the data
frame and the sender retransmits the data frame.</p>
<p>How deos the sender know that there was an error and retransmits the
frame. flow control is also important as the sender and the receiver may
have different speeds. To solve these we have some algorithms. Stop and
wait, go back n, and selective repeat. They all are variations of an
algorithm named sliding window. These all together is called ARQ
automatic repeat request. Repeat requests happens automatically.</p>
<p><img src="img_12.png" alt="img_12.png" /></p>
<h3 id="multiple-access">Multiple access</h3>
<p>The last functionality provided by data link layer is called multiple
access. wi-fi - CS-MA/CA is used.</p>
<p>They had a shared medium. To access the shared medium they could be
using frequency division multiplexing. They have different frequency
domain in which they can share the medium, but that reduces the
bandwidth of every device to 1/n when there are n devices on the
network. What happens in practice, the traffic of these devices come in
burst.</p>
<p>Another division could be time division multiplexes. Every device
gets a fix allotted time to transfer the data. Most of the device is
idle most of the time and one device may have to send huge amount of
data.</p>
<p>For these issues we cannot use TDM or FDM. Algorithm used ALOHA, and
CSMA/CD.</p>
<p>For WIFI we use CSMA/CA.</p>
<h1 id="4-different-delays-in-computers">4. Different Delays in
Computers</h1>
<h2 id="transmission-delay">Transmission delay</h2>
<p>The transmission delay is the time taken by the sender to put the
data in the communication channel. Depends upon link bandwidth and
packet length.</p>
<h1 id="network-layer-1">Network layer</h1>
<p>internet layer. prefix. contiguous ip addresses. subnet. prefix
network address. make the bandwidth control divide the big packet into
smaller packets. ip and subnetting</p>
<h1 id="10-circuit-switching-vs-packet-switching">10. Circuit switching
vs Packet Switching</h1>
<p>make a connection, maintain a connection and close the connection
when over. In circuit switching. Every packet have a destination
address.</p>
<p>what we do in packet switching is there are two ways to one way is
that every packet will have a destination address. This can go through
different routers and routers have buffer inside them. If a router’s
buffer is full it cannot receive any more packets. so it drops packets.
so if every packet has a destination address is added to it may take a
different path if it sees congestion.</p>
<p>store and forward packet switching.</p>
